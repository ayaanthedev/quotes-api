# Quotes API

üìú This is a simple Express.js API that provides a collection of quotes. The quotes are fetched from a JSON file named "quotes.json". The API has two endpoints: `/quote` and `/quote` (HTTP GET and POST, respectively).

## Example: 
Here is a working example of a <a href="https://300talha.github.io/quote-generator/">Quote Generator ‚ú®<a>

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/well300/quotes-api.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```
cd quotes-api
npm install
```
3.Start the server:
```
npm start
```
## API Endpoints
### GET /quote
Fetches a random quote from the "quotes.json" file and returns it as a JSON response.
For example, in your client-side JavaScript code, you can use the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the `/quote` endpoint on your server:
```
fetch('https://quotes-api-dev.vercel.app/quote')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Handle the retrieved quote
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error(error);
  });

```

Example response:
```
{
  "quote": "Be the change you wish to see in the world.",
  "author": "Mahatma Gandhi"
}
```
## POST /quote
Adds a new quote to the "quotes.json" file. The request body should contain the quote and author in JSON format.

Example request:
```
{
  "quote": "It always seems impossible until it's done.",
  "author": "Nelson Mandela"
}
```
Example response:
```
{
  "quote": "It always seems impossible until it's done.",
  "author": "Nelson Mandela"
}
```
## Error handling
If an error occurs while fetching or adding a quote, the API will return a JSON response with an "error" property:
```
{
  "error": "Unable to fetch a quote."
}
```
## GET /quoteoftheday
Fetches the **Quote of the Day**, selected deterministically based on the current date, so the same quote is served throughout the day. This allows users to get a daily inspirational quote that changes every day.

**Example usage:**
```
fetch('https://quotes-api-dev.vercel.app/quoteoftheday')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Quote of the Day:', data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

**Example Response:**
```
{
  "quote": "The only way to do great work is to love what you do.",
  "author": "Steve Jobs"
}
```

**If a Error Happens:**
```
Unable to fetch quote of the day.
```
